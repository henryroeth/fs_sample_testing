#### Internship Description
The [James H. Barrow Biological Field Station](https://www.hiram.edu/academics/field-stations/barrow-field-station/) hosts a wide variety of biological studies and tests. From caring for, rehabilitating, and researching endangered and common species alike to integrating education and technology, JHBBFS provides an outlet for a whole manner of fields in the sciences. I am a Computer Science major here at Hiram College and I have taken on the Development and Deployment of Weather and Trace Gas Monitoring Systems internship.

#### Data Records
Here is where all of the data is stored. Readings from the [WS-2000 Weather Station](https://ambientweather.com/ws-2000-smart-weather-station) and [Outdoor PM2.5 Gas Monitor](https://ambientweather.com/pm25-wireless-outdoor-particulate-monitor) from [Ambient Weather](https://ambientweather.com/) are recorded and stored into this repository so we can manipulate, analyze, and store important weather data. 
##### [Data Records](https://github.com/henryroeth/fs_sample_testing/tree/main/data_records): Here is where our main, daily files are stored. Values of a variety of weather readings are recorded every second of every day, allowing for incredibly detailed data sets.
##### [Channel Files](https://github.com/henryroeth/fs_sample_testing/tree/main/data_records/channel_files): Here is where the channel files are housed. This is for very specific readings, namely the [soil moisture sensor](https://ambientweather.com/wh31sm-soil-moisture-sensor) that is have stationed in one of the gardens above the stream building where all of JHBBFS birds are stored and rehabilitated. 
##### [Beta Records](https://github.com/henryroeth/fs_sample_testing/tree/main/data_records/beta_records): These are records that were taken prior to July 1st. These records can be used for data analysis, but are considered beta records becuase a lot of setting up and finalizing of our weather system's general function went into this period of data collection, so data may not be as accurate. 
##### [Averages](https://github.com/henryroeth/fs_sample_testing/tree/main/data_records/averages): These are records that showcase the daily averages, allowing us to narrow down the readings into a more useable data set.
