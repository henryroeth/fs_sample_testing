# James H. Barrow Biological Field Station Internship
### Development & Deployment of Weather and Trace Gas Monitoring Systems
### Description
The [James H. Barrow Biological Field Station](https://www.hiram.edu/academics/field-stations/barrow-field-station/) hosts a wide variety of biological studies and tests. From caring for, rehabilitating, and researching endangered and common species alike to integrating education and technology, JHBBFS provides an outlet to a whole manner of fields in the sciences. I am a Computer Science major and I have taken on the Development and Deployment of Weather and Trace Gas Monitoring Systems internship here. Myself and Patyon Dennis, the other intern that I have been working with, have been able to develop and extract data from various weather reading equipment, namely Pm2.5 Gas Monitoring Sensors.
